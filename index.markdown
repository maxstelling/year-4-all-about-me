and as for forwards it leads to up stairs

later we went  to the parrog climbed on the rocks.

and the next day

and our friends Andy emma and robin and lilian came over for the rest of the week
but it was too full for everyone to fit so ada an ivy went into ivys room ada and ivy slept in beds and i slept on the air matres

the next day we went to betis and i got stung by a jellyfish.

it fels like pins and kneedles but without the pins at first it fells paralysing after is kneedly it stops stinging afer a few minutes.

and its hard to walk for a little while after.

the next day we woke up to fly our kite
