seagull cottage Newport
on Saturday the day after the end of term at about 9:21 we all ran around getting ready around with rosa asleep (luckily) then we got in the car and set off on our 4 hour journey
4 hours later
we arrived at low tide
and we went inside to meet my grandparents
first we decided witch rooms we were going to sleep in.
as you go into the house there are 3 options if you go left you enter the living room if you turn right you enter the dining room and as for forwards it leads to up stairs
later we went to the parrog climbed on the rocks.
and the next day my grandparents had to leave but we stayed and our friends Andy Emma and robin and Lilian came over for the rest of the week but it was too full for everyone to fit so ada an ivy went into ivy room ada and ivy slept in beds and i slept on the air mattress
the next day we went to bettws and i got stung by a jellyfish.
it felt like pins and needles but without the pins at first it fells paralysing after is needless it stops stinging after a few minutes.
and it's hard to walk for a little while after.
the next day we woke up to fly our kite but the was sewage  coming from Trenydd and we saw jellyfish and a small live one was in a pool a family was protecting it from the seagulls. that night we had a bbq and after tea we went to the big sands and ada and i sort of got lost and helicopters were looking for us!! DU DU DUNN!!!
The next day we had to leave so we packed up and while the adults were packing me ada ivy Lilian+robin played tag in the garden after the adults finished packing. Andy Emma Lilian and robin waved good bye and went up the hill to go home. a few minutes later we did the same. and then we set off on our next car ride the next day we had a bit of a lazy day because my mum had to un-pac
then the car broke down so all that week we were inside!
