### seagull cottige newport
 on satuday the day after the end of term
at abbout 9:21 we all ran around getting ready around with rosa alssleep (luckily)
then we got in the car and set off on our 4 hour journey

*4 hours later*

we arrived at low tide

and we went inside to meet my grandparents

first we decided witch rooms we were going to sleep in.

as you go into the house there ar 3 options if you go left you enter the living room if you turn right you enter the dining room
and as for forwards it leads to up stairs

later we went  to the parrog
(witch is directley in front of us)

and the next day
my grandparents
had to leave but we stayed
and our friends Andy emma and robin and lilian came over for the rest of the week
butit was too full for everyone to fit so ada an i went into ivys room ada and ivy slept in beds and i slept on the air matres

the next day we went to betis and i got stung by a jellyfish.

it fels like pins and kneedles but without the pins at first it fells paralysing after is kneedly it stops stinging afer a few minutes.

and its hard to walk for a little while after.

the next day we woke up to fly our kite
but the was sewage comeing from treath
and we saw jellyfish and a small live one was  in a pool  a family was protecting it from the seagulls.
that night we had a bbq and after tea we went to the big sands and ada and i sort of got lost and helecopters were looking for us!!
the next day we had to leave so we packed up and left.
